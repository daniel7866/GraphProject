# GraphProject
A graph library I made, including a GUI application of graphs.

The graph library is a generic graph, it has edges with weights, and it has graph's algorithms.

In the GUI application the user can:

-Draw a graph visually with nodes and edges.
-Can scan the graph with bfs and dfs from a specific vertex in the graph
-Can save the graph to a file and load it anytime.

When scanning the graph with any algorithm - for example bfs all the scanned edges will turn red but with a cool animation - the edges will be painted step by step in order of the bfs.
